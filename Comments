The file you have posted is a strange conglomeration of the original code and the new 2-D array version
that we put together in class.  

It doesn't compile, so there's no way to test it.

You restructured MOST of it as a 2-D array, but left key parts untouched - line 28 in particular, and
checkForWin (starting @ line 70) as well.

Right now, 4/10.  Half back if you fix the problems.
